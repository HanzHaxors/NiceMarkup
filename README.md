> Taken from [examples/hello.nice](examples/hello.nice)

We don't have any closing tag and we use css selector (soon WIP) to define the elements

## Usage
```sh
nice <sourceFile> [destinationFolder]
```
If `destinationFolder` is not defined, the destination folder name will be based on `sourceFile`.

## Examples
There is so many examples in [examples folder](examples), you're welcome.
